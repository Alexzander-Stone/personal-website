Add .md file for the project in pages/projects

Make sure to include the width and height values, so the initial load-in of the page doesn't look janky (elements will constantly resize during the initial load-in if the user has no cache).
(to find optimal values, just go to the projects page, and turn off the width/height. Then look at the auto adjusted values, and copy those.)
