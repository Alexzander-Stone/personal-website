### The Why

Many years ago, while I was a Junior at Clemson University, I took one of my favorite classes by Dr. Malloy called **Data-Driven 2D Video Game Development**.

It was essentially a way to teach C++ concepts such as operator overloading, object-oriented programming, design patterns, the standard library, and debugging.

More important for me, it was a class where, as long as you hit a few set goals defined by the professor, you could make any type of game engine and game!

I have fond memories staying up late during the night to work on this, so I decided to make a quick project post here.

*(Plus, it's one of my few public projects hahahahah)*

And a [github link](https://github.com/Alexzander-Stone/Doom-Remade-C--4160) to the project.
