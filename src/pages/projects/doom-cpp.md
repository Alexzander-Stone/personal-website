### The Why

Many years ago, when I was a junior at Clemson University, I enrolled in one of my favorite classes taught by Dr. Malloy, titled **Data-Driven 2D Video Game Development**.

This course served as a platform for teaching essential C++ concepts, including operator overloading, object-oriented programming, design patterns, utilization of the standard library, and debugging techniques.

What made this class particularly significant for me was the freedom it offered. As long as you met certain predetermined objectives set by the professor, you had the creative liberty to develop any type of game engine and game you desired.

I have cherished memories of staying up late into the night to work on this project, which is why I've decided to share a quick post about it here.

(Besides, it's one of my few publicly available projects hahahahah)
